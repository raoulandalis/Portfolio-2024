          <p>Before diving into the world of coding, I actually had a different pathâ€”I started out in healthcare. After earning my bachelor's at the University of Florida, I spent some time as an EMT, where I learned the importance of quick thinking and problem-solving under pressure.</p>

          <p>However, I felt a calling towards something different. I discovered my love for creating and building, and that's what brought me to where I am now. I'm currently immersed in a full stack bootcamp, where I'm combining my previous experiences with my newfound passion for coding. It's been an exciting journey of discovery and growth!</p>

But most importantly, I'm excited to keep learning and exploring new possibilities, because in this field, there's always something new to discover!</p>
